# Alpine GNU C library (glibc) Docker Image

This image is based on the Apline Linux Image, which is only 5MB, and it includes glibc enabling proprietary projects compiled against glibc to run.

It is based largely on the work of (Sasha Gerrand)[https://github.com/sgerrand]; pulling from (alpine-pkg-glibc)[https://github.com/sgerrand/alpine-pkg-glibc], (docker-glibc-builder)[https://github.com/sgerrand/docker-glibc-builder], and an (issue)[ https://github.com/sgerrand/docker-glibc-builder/issues/20] on that repo raised by (Noel Georgi)[https://github.com/frezbo].
